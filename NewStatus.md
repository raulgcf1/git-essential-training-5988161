my favorite joke is one famously retold by the late author Christopher Hitchens

what does the buddist say to the hot dog vendor?

"make me one with everything"

the vendor makes the hotdog and hands it to the monk, the monk pays with a 20 bill and waits a while

he later asks the vendor "where's my change?"

the vendor replies "ah, change only comes from within"
